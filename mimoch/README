I have attached the original TGn model doc.

Also attached is chmodel_code.zip that has matlab codes that I created for localization research. Two files of importance are:

>> tgn802p11nChannel: Models up to 4x4 MIMO channel model described in the TGn doc
>> tgn802p11nChannel2: This script models two 802.11n channels, one is for the signal of interest and the other is for the source of interference.

Hopefully the comments in the code are clear enough but please let me know if you need any clarifications.

Also this script uses bell shaped doppler spectrum for modeling walking speed, you need to add a component to model the the moving vehicle. This is in lin#39 of tgn802p11nMPF.m.

Example usage :

%Applies the TGn 802.11n model to the input stream
%d: distance between the tx-rx
%ts: sampling interval
%in:input vector to the channel
%SNR: SNR at the output of the channel (dB)
%seednum: seednumber to control the Gaussian noise
%type: Valid input A-F represnting the ModelA-F of 802.11n, TGn model
%Aoanew = mean Angle of Arrival of the first cluster, all the remaining AOA
%will be adjusted with relative to the first AOA
