uep_simul is the file that simulates UEP and computes BER. It's results are stored in ./results/

vidwifi_interleave and vidwifi_deinterleave are the major changes in the chain. The complete chain is visible in uep_simul.m

interleave_test_case shows you an example of how the interleaved block looks.

Located in Apex/jeff
Apex should be shared with you.

Results include files named uep_ber_54_1 and the likes. 54 = 54 MBps. 1 = P:I ratio.  Load the file to get UEP_BIT_ERRORS map.
UEP_BIT_ERRORS(20) will give you the UEP ber for I data, P data and total data.
eg.

>> UEP_BIT_ERRORS(20)
