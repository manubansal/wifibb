The trace data is worth 48000 Bytes.
It is divided into I and P data [higher / lower priority], according to the P:I ratio.
'load' the file and the variable UEP_stream contains the required data.

rate	  nbpsc		P:I ratio	file name
36	  4		2:2 = 1	      uep_tx_36_1.mat
36	  4		3:1 = 3	      uep_tx_36_3.mat
54	  6		3:3 = 1	      uep_tx_54_1.mat
54	  6		4:2 = 2	      uep_tx_54_2.mat
54	  6		5:1 = 5	      uep_tx_54_5.mat

This data will give you 500 payloads of 96 Bytes each. The P:I ratio dictates
how many of I and P should be used for a single payload. 

This information - variables nI_elpp: number of I elements[bytes] per packet 
and nP_elpp - is essential as inputs to the two separate chains of padding, 
scrambling, convencoding and puncturing.

In particular,
ratio	  nI_elpp     nP_elpp 
1	  48	      48
2	  32	      64
3	  24	      72
5	  16	      80


As a first sanity check on the TX side, the files also contain a variable called 
UEP_SAMPLES - 1 x 500 cell - each cell containing the complex signal constellation samples
corresponding to each payload. This is right before adding awgn noise in the
matlab script [Remember: matlab script contains tx chain upto the stage before IFFT]
